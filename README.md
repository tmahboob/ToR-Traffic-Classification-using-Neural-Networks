''' Neural Network based encrypted traffic classification for statistical time-related features with TCP timeout values of 15s, 30s, 60s, and 120s. 
Study the ToR traffic patterns and TCP timeout impact'''.


This repository contains source code for a Neual Network based encrypted traffic classification, specifically the ToR traffic.
The dataset has two folders for TCP timeout based statistical time-related features:
  1. Scenario A: Tor vs non Tor Traffic temporal featuers in arff format
  2. Scenario B: Application Service Classification for 8 different types of traffic

Note: Do not RUN one of the notebook marked as "DO NOT RUN" as it contains final results!!!!!
